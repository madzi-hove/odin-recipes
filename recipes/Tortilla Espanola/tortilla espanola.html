			Tortilla espa√±ola is a Spanish omelette made of egg, potato, and onion
			cooked in olive oil.
		</h2>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more if needed</li>
			<li>2 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
			<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>
				<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste
			</li>
			<li>1 sweet Spanish onion, thinly sliced</li>
			<li>6 eggs</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
			<li>1 bunch fresh parsley, coarsely chopped</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
			<li>
				In an ovenproof skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil
				until it shimmers, and place the potatoes into the hot oil. Season with
				salt and pepper, and sprinkle with smoked paprika. Pan fry the potatoes,
				stirring and tossing occasionally, until they are beginning to soften,
				about 8 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally,
				until the potatoes and onion are slightly browned and the onion is
				translucent, about 10 more minutes. Take the skillet off the heat, and
				allow to cool for about 5 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Beat the eggs with 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a large bowl. Stir in the
				parsley, add the potato-onion mixture, and lightly combine.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the skillet over medium heat until it
				shimmers, then gently spoon the egg-potato mixture into the hot skillet.
				Reduce heat to medium-low, and shake the skillet a few times to help
				release the omelet from the bottom of the skillet.
			</li>
			<li>
				Slide the skillet into the preheated oven, and bake until the omelet is
				puffed and the top is golden brown, about 5 minutes. A toothpick
				inserted into the center of the omelet should come out clean. Cut the
				omelet into pie-shaped pieces, and serve hot.
			</li>
